Description
===========

This module provides methods to convert Docbook XML to POD, and to merge
POD into a Perl document.

This modules allows module documentation to be written as Docbook
article and then converted to POD - and optionally merged into the
module being documented. This allows for the use of Docbook editors to
maintain documentation as separate entities if desired.
